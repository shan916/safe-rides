            The Safe Rides Program is designed to prevent incidents related to drinking and driving that lead to
            accidents, DUI/DWI arrests, and death. However, Safe Rides is also a safety net. It can be used in many
            different situations. For instance, Safe Rides
            can be used to get home from a bad date, a late movie, or a broken down car.
